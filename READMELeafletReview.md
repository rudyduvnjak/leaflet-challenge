# Leaflet Assignment: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to Leaflet-Challenge projecct. Objective of this project is to pull USGS Eathquake data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), github data from <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates> and display it in html. There are two basic layers from open street map, steet map and topographic map. On top of basic layers we have explored creating two different layers from two different data sources earthquake data, and tectonic plate lines in advanced portion. 

### Tools Used

- HTML

- Javascript

- Leaflet for data visualization

- D3 Lobrary

## Project Development

### Basic Visualization

- Used USGS data to pull in data in geoJSON format
- Pulled coordinates for each earthquake instance
- Pulled earthquake magnitude to create bubble  markers
- Used popup function to create popup elements such as location, magnitude, and time of recorded data
- Created legend for each earquake depth, third coordinate to represent each depth with different color
- Visualised data using Leaflet

### Advanced Data Visualisaion

- Used github tectonic plate geoJSON data to plot tectonic plates lines
- Used D3 library to pull in data 
- Plotted tectonic plates lines using Leaflet in advanced portion of assignment

### Lessons Learned

- Use of D3 library to pull data in to JavaScript
- Use of Leaflet library for plotting maps
- Expanded knowledge of JavaScript
